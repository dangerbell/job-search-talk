### Make your resume stand out

### Bad Resume

### Nexopia

- Developed frontend javascript site using backend API
- Achieved project goals as required
- Worked as part of a team to create software

### Better Resume

### Nexopia (March 2008 - March 2010)

- Developed new UI components for a user-configurable website using Ruby and Javascript.
- Involved in the full product pipeline including requirements gathering, UX design, and implementation.
- Solved problems related to scaling servers, processes, and database to reach 10,000+ simultaneous users.

### Risky Resume

### Nexopia (March 2008 - March 2010)

- Developed UI components for a very cool redesign of the user profile page at the "rock 'n' roll Facebook". The user profile page was the most important part of a broad site redesign. It included a number of user-configurable modules like a photo carousel, free-form rich text, polls, galleries, friends list, and comments. The pages were served from a Ruby backend and included many Javascript interactions.
- Learned about dealing with harsh criticism and how not to do user engagement.
- Gained a good understanding of the full product pipeline. Working with great designers and product development people taught me a lot about effective requirements gathering, the iterative design process, the importance of UX to product success, and how asking questions early is cheaper than asking questions later.

### Resume Tips

- Make a master resume as you are working with detailed descriptions of your accomplishments. You will forget about most of these.
- Tailor the resume to the job posting. If it asks for front-end experience highlight that and reduce the detail on your backend jobs.
- Make older sections shorter. They are less relevant and you will have trouble giving details and answering questions about them.
- Don't include "skills" that you only used once for a class project
- Do include skills & technologies you're using in side projects and highlight the side project
- Link to open source code if you can or other examples of work that are publically available

---

### Job Search Attitude

- !!! Treat it like a job !!!

- Get up, have a shower, get dressed, "commute" to work
